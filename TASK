POLICY:-

Q1.Create a policy to access all objects in a specific bucket.
----- create policy
      -allow for actions list and read permssion.
      -give bucket arn
       -create policy and attach to user

Q2.Create a policy to access only 2 objects in a specific bucket.
----- create policy
      -allow for actions list and read permssion.
      -give bucket arn also give objects arn.
      -create policy and attach to user

Q3.Create a policy to deny the access of Specific bucket.
-create resource based policy for bucket in json deny for all actions 
  {
  "Id": "Policy1702550019834",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1702550010493",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dhanubuck2",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::689385686280:user/dhanu"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
Why we create resource based policy?
-When we create policy allow access for s3 buckets but if we want to deny access of specific bucket 
 for specific user for that create resource based policy for bucket.

Another Way

Q4.Create policy to create the user only and can attach policy to them.
----- list -list users
      read -GetAccountPasswordPolicy
      write - create user

Q5.Create a policy to place the user in a group only.
----- create policy for user to add another user in group
      allow for action and select actions
      read= list user, list group, list group for user
      read= get group
      write= add user

Q6. Policy to get "read" access of all users, groups but not policy.
---- create policy to a read all users and group but but not policy
     create policy and allow for actions :- 
     list - list users, list groups.

Q7. Policy to get access to billing, ec2 and cloudwatch.
---- we cannot able to give access of billing bcoz only user can acess billing
     give permission of ec2 and cloudwatch for user.
