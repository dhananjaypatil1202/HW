Q1.What is EC2, Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?
-->With help of EC2 we cretae an virtual machine called as instances in EC2.
   Bcz it provide scalability, fault tolerance, high availability with help of different resources.
   We have only pay for what we use.
   Anytime we create instances when we no need after that simply delete that m/c.

Q2.Features of Amazon EC2 ?
-->it provide different types of machine we create as own requirement on the basis work loads.
   On our demand we scale up & scale down on our demand.
   We also choose different price model as our requirement.
   
Q3.What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
--> It is an software that creates and runs virtual machines on hardware
    Types Bare metal and Hosted
    Bare metal means these hypervisors run directly on hardware without need any OS.
    we use Xzen in AWS,
    Hosted means it runs on OS. SO it will takes hardware resources from host OS. EX:- Virtual Box.
                      
Q4.Where we use hypervisor
--> 

Q5.Steps to create an EC2 instance.
--> Give name of instance 
    Choose AMI as our requirement AMI decide os like Redhat,ubuntu,linux
    Choose instance types like how many cpu, ram we required.
    Generate key pair either you have already a key pair choose key pairs
    choose Network group and set inbound and outbound rules.
    Specify how many ram required

Q6.EC2 Instance state ?
--> PENDING
    RUNNING
    STOPPING
    STOP
    SHUTTING-DOWN
    TERMINATED

Q7.How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes ?
--> 

Q8.What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ?
--> When we hibernate our instance after outinstance go to sleep mode.

Q9.What is KMS ?
--> Basically is an service use for encryption of columes.
    KMS for key with help of keys Volumes are encrypted.
    
Q10.AWS Amazon EC2 Instance types ?
--> General purpose
    Compute optimized
    Memory optimized
    Storage optimized
    Accelerated computing.

Q11.How many types of status checks happen in aws ?
--> 2/2 - ALL ok
    0/1-  Software issue
    0/2-  hardware issue

Q12.When we see the global view option in ec2 service ?
--> It shows All regions of aws and how many resources you are create in EC2.

Q13.When we logged into the cloud account by default why do we always jump into the north virginia region, why it’s most popular ?
--> Bcz it is an 1st region launched by AWS 
    When any new service oer resources are comes in AWS so 1st it launch in VIRGINIAN region,
    High availability of this region bcz It has 6 AZs.

Q14.What are EBS Volumes and its types ?
--> EBS is an network level storage and it is persistent.
    And data are stored in the form of blocks and os runs on these volums.
    General purpose SDD 
    Provisioned IOPSSDD
    Throughput HDD 

Q15.Purpose of Using EBS volumes ?
--> It is an network level storage 
    Persistent 
    As our own requirement we increase and decrease size.
    It is easy to take backup (snapshot)
    It easy to detach and attach to another instance no chances to data lost.
    
Q16.How many types of purchasing options do we have in aws ec2 ?
-->  On demand- 
     Dedicated host
     Dedicated instance 
     Spot instance
     Reserved instance

Q17.Difference between AWS AMI Image & AWS Template ?
--> We create Template for autoscaling group it means when instance are created same replica \
    created which we are configured in template.    
    AWS AMI image means backup of software or volume
    suppose that you have instamce all webserver application are configured and you need another instance 
    with same configuration so why we need to waste time for creating another instance
    Create Image of existing instance after create instamce from AMI IMAGE. 

Q18.What is NIC & it’s types ?
--> 

Q19.What is elastic IP ? & WHY were we used ?
--> Elastic IP means static like it will not change over time when we stopped an EC2 machine
    bcz it will change when we stopped an ec2 m/c.

Q20.What is the snapshot of why we use it ?
--> snapshot is an backup and point-in-copy of ebs volumes
    for backup purpose we use snapshot.

Q21.How can we save money in snapshot costing, if an automated snapshot has been created ?
--> for that we create snapshot 

Q22.What is the lifecycle manager in snapshot ?
--> suppose we have to take backup/snapshot of volumes daily for that set
How does the Amazon lifecycle manager work ?
Difference between Security Group & NACL ?
What are NACL & Its types ?
How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
How many types of volume states do we have ?
What is a key pair, and its types ?
What is load balancer and its types ?
How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
Features of Load Balancers ?
What is ASG ? & Its types ?
What is a Health Check ?
What is the threshold ?
What is the group of LB ?
Why do we prefer ALB over ALB ?
Difference between Web server & Application server ?
What is the target group ?
What is the desired capacity in ASG ?
How many types of the Scaling option ?
Scaling plans ?
Types Auto scaling
Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
What is difference between EBS/EFS/S3
